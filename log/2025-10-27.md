Let's work together.
I want to rewrite the whole package in . to implement it following software
engineer practices.
The modules should all be in `src` without any other folder.

Note that I use uv and therefore any command is to be run with `uv run`.
I don't have `python` installed (only work through uv).
After a file has been implemented you shall check that it works appropriately
writing the opportune tests in the folder `tests`, using the utility pytest.

Let's start with the file data.py. Let's rewrite the whole code in smaller
function to minimize the amount of code that is written. Notably the variable
must be meaningful and therefore I don't care about the the length of the
names, I want simple functions with intuitive name to tackle the problem.
Secondly I want to maintain the same interface, therefore the four functions
make_loaders, get_mnist_data(), get_cifar_data() should still be defined
