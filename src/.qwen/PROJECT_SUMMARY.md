# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement a complete deep learning framework with a PyTorch LeNet model, MNIST dataset loading, and a scikit-learn compatible neural network wrapper that supports training feedback with tqdm progress bars and model persistence.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: PyTorch for neural networks, scikit-learn for compatibility, tqdm for progress bars, datasets library for MNIST
- **Directory Structure**: `/src/models/` contains neural network implementations, `/src/dataset.py` for data loading, `/src/models/utils.py` for scikit-learn wrappers
- **Model Architecture**: LeNet implementation with 2 conv layers (20, 50 filters), 2 pooling layers, 2 FC layers (500, 10 units) matching Caffe defintion
- **MNIST Handling**: Dataset loads all digits (0-9) from ylecun/mnist, flattened to 784-dimensional vectors
- **Scikit-learn Compatibility**: PyTorchNeuralNetworkWrapper implements BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin with fit, predict, predict_proba, score methods
- **Progress Tracking**: Training includes tqdm progress bar with loss display every `loss_every_num_epochs`
- **Model Persistence**: save_model/load_model methods preserve both model weights and training parameters

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Created models directory and implemented PyTorch LeNet based on Caffe definition
- [DONE] Implemented MNIST dataset loading for all digits using datasets library
- [DONE] Created scikit-learn compatible neural network wrapper with fit/predict interface
- [DONE] Added tqdm progress bar with loss display during training
- [DONE] Implemented save/load functionality for model persistence
- [DONE] Tested all components together with successful save/load verification
- [DONE] Verified predictions match between original and loaded models
- [DONE] Added helper function get_pretrained_model for easier model creation

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Complete framework implementation and testing
- [DONE] Verify all components work together
- [DONE] Ensure model persistence maintains training state properly
- [TODO] Integrate with sws_compressor for soft weight sharing
- [TODO] Run comprehensive tests with various model configurations
